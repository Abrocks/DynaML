Aim
============

DynaML is a scala library/repl for implementing and working with general Machine Learning models. Machine Learning/AI applications make heavy use of various entities such as graphs, vectors, matrices etc as well as classes of mathematical models which deal with broadly three kinds of tasks, prediction, classification and clustering.

The aim is to build a robust set of abstract classes and interfaces, which can be extended easily to implement advanced models for small and large scale applications. But the library can also be used as an educational/research tool for multi scale data analysis. 

Currently DynaML has implementations of Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) for binary classification and regression. For further background consider [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares_support_vector_machine) or the [book](http://www.amazon.com/Least-Squares-Support-Vector-Machines/dp/9812381511).   

A good general introduction to Probabilistic Models for Machine Learning can be found [here](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/textbook/131214.pdf) in [David Barber's](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Brml.HomePage) text book. The LS-SVM is equivalent to the class of models discussed in Chapter 18 (Bayesian Linear Models) of the book.



Documentation
=============
You can refer to the project [documentation]({{site.url}}/documentation) for getting started with DynaML. Bear in mind that this is still at its infancy and there will be many more improvements/tweaks in the future.
