### Platform Compatibility

Currently DynaML installs and runs on *nix platforms, though it is possible to build the project on windows, running the generated .bat file might not work and one would need to resort to using the `java -jar` command.

### Pre-requisites

* sbt
* A modern HTML5 enabled browser (to view plots generated by Wisp)
* BLAS, LAPACK and ARPACK binaries for your platform. In case they are not installed, it is possible to disable this feature by commenting out (`//`) the section of the build.sbt file given below.
  
  ```scala
    "org.scalanlp" % "breeze-natives_2.11" % "0.11.2" % "compile",
  ```

### Steps

* Clone this repository
* Run the following.
```shell
  sbt
```

The sbt shell will open

```shell
 [info] Loading project definition from ~/DynaML/project
 [info] Set current project to DynaML (in build file:~/Development/DynaML/)
 >
```

Now enter the following commands

```shell
>stage
>console
```

After the project builds, you should get the following prompt.
  
```
