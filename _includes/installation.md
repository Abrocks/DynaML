### Platform Compatibility

Currently DynaML installs and runs on *nix platforms, though it is possible to build the project on windows, running the generated .bat file might not work and one would need to resort to using the `java -jar` command.

### Pre-requisites

* Apache Maven
* A modern HTML5 enabled browser (to view plots generated by Wisp)
* BLAS, LAPACK and ARPACK binaries for your platform. In case they are not installed, it is possible to disable this feature by commenting out (`<!-- -->`) the section of the pom.xml file given below.
  
  ```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.scalanlp</groupId>
      <artifactId>breeze-natives_2.10</artifactId>
      <version>0.10</version>
    </dependency>
  ```

### Steps

* Clone this repository
* Run the following.

  ```shell
    mvn clean compile
    mvn package
  ```

* Make sure you give execution permission to `DynaML` in the `target/bin` directory.

  ```shell
    chmod +x target/bin/DynaML
    target/bin/DynaML
  ```

You should get the following prompt.
  
```
